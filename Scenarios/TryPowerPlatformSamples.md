# Try one of the Business Central and Power Platform samples

The easiest way to get started with Business Central and Power Apps is to find one of our sample apps:

- [Take Order](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/TakeOrder)
- [Warehouse helper](https://github.com/BusinessCentralDemos/WarehouseHelper) 

From the sample app repository, you can create a fork of the repo. This gives you all the source code for the Canvas app and AL extension, so you just need to follow the steps in [Power Platform repository setup](./SetupPowerPlatform.md), and you are ready to publish the latest changes to your environment.
