# Reference Documentation

A vital part of your development processes is reference documentation. AL-Go for GitHub supports the ALDoc tool for reference documentation generation, either continuously as part of CI/CD, manually or scheduled.

The ALDoc tool generates content based on the source code. Generating content based on source code has many advantages such as accuracy, 100% reflection of the current codebase, less error prone documentation, and it saves time. The ALDoc tool generates documentation from symbolic and syntactical information, code comments, and overall application structure based on input .app file(s). The tool also generates a help site with these reference articles, sorted by the application structure, based on the provided template.






Maybe it is about time to actually explain how you create a development environment and code your app?
